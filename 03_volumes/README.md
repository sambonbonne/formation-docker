# Build me

Build me with the tag `formation/volume`

# Run me

Try running me without arguments: `docker run formation/volume`

It doesn't work? Maybe add some arguments!

Hint: `docker help run | grep volume`

## When it works

When I'm running, in another terminal, use `echo "I changed you" > content.txt`
